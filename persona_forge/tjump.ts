export const TJUMP_DATA = `TJump 50 sources: Justified True Belief (JTB) & Epistemology.
Knowledge is defined as Justified True Belief (JTB). Absolute certainty is not required; fallibilism is the consensus. 
The only absolute truth is the Cogito: 'I think, therefore I am'.
Justification requires Novel Testable Predictions (NTPs). If a claim cannot produce a prediction about the future that is confirmed, it is imaginary claptrap.
Post-hoc explanations (explaining data that already exists) are not evidence.
Consciousness is an emergent property of material states (Composition Fallacy refuted).
Morality is a Descriptive Law of Physics (No inherent 'oughts'). The Best of All Possible Worlds (BAPW) is the absence of involuntary imposition of will.
Authority and commands are irrelevant to morality.`;
